<h1>Help</h1>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<p>The Process Model is arranged in 3 columns. From left to right:<p>
  <ol>
    <li>The process diagram. Build up your model here.</li>
    <li>Details about the currently selected node or edge.</li>
    <li>This help column.</li>
  </ol>

<p>At the leftmost border of each column is a darker line which may be used to resize them. Left-click and drag for precise resize. Left-click without dragging to toggle hiding/showing the column.</p>

<h2>Pan and Zoom</h2>
<p>Click and drag on an empty area of the diagram to move around.</p>

<p>Zoom in and out using your mouse scrollwheel. Alternatively, if you have a touchscreen or trackpad, use the standard pinch zoom gestures.</p>

<h2>Nodes</h2>
<p>The Process Model is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a>. It is formed of nodes connected to other nodes through edges. The leftmost node is called the root. All nodes without any edges coming out of them are called leaves.</p>

<p>To the right of most nodes (some cannot have children) is a circle, which we call the junction. Left click on this to create a new node.</p>

<p>To create a new edge between to existing nodes, left-click and drag from a junction onto another node. This may not always be allowed, as there are restrictions the kinds of nodes which may be connected.</p>

<p>At the end of each edge is a smaller circle. Left click on this to disconnect that edge. Disconnecting all edges from a node will remove it.</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>By default, nodes and edges are layed out automatically left-to-right.</p>

<p>Left-click and drag on a node to position it manually. Left-click and drag on the resize handle at the bottom-right of each node to resize it.</p>
<p>Right-click on a manually positioned or sized node to return it to automatic layout with the default size.</p>
