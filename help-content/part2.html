<p>The model has support for importing xml files exported from PeriMeta. Again, drag and drop the file onto the page.</p>

<h3>Wiki Integration</h3>
<p>The model may also be loaded from and saved to a set of linked <a href="https://github.com/jgm/gitit">Gitit</a> wiki pages.</p> 

<p>Each node in the diagram is represented by one page containing a table of its properties and a table of hyperlinks to its children along with edge properties.</p>

<p>Other content present on the page will be used to populate the node's description.</p>
