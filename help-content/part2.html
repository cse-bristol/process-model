<h2>Import and Export</h2>
<p>You may save your process model by clicking on the download link. You can reload the file produced by dragging and dropping it back onto the page.<p>

<p>The model has support for importing xml files exported from PeriMeta. Again, drag and drop the file onto the page.</p>

<h3>Wiki Integration</h3>
<p>The model may also be loaded from and saved to a set of linked <a href="https://github.com/jgm/gitit">Gitit</a> wiki pages. Each node will get its own page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The URL of the page (made relative to the base URL of the wiki) becomes the name of the node.</li>
  <li>A table containing a column named 'child', and optionally columns 'necessity' and 'sufficiency', is a list of edges. The 'child' column should contain an HTML link.</li>
  <li>The properties for each type of node belong in another table, which has a column for each property and a single row containing the values.</li>
  <li>Other content present on the page will be used to populate the node's description.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you will either need to serve all pages from the same origin, or add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the parent page.</p>
